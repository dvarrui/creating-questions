# Contributions

If you want to contribute:
* Talk about this tool with your colleagues.
* Use this tool as much as posible.
* Report bugs to us (AskerTeam).
* Report us, your ideas for new features. "4 eyes see more than 2".
* Share with us your own input files and "create a better world".

But if you love `git`, `md files` or `ruby`, you can develop with us or work on the issues.

1. Fork this repo (make "your-asker-repo")
2. Make changes into "your-asker-repo".
3. git add, git commit, git push
4. Wait until AskerTeam could revise your request
5. And that's all. :-)
