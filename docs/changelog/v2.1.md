# version 2.1

Things/ideas to do for 2.1 Asker version.

## GUI

Create a graphic fron end to execute asker and edit input files.

## Videos

* Documentation: Revise documentation
* Perhaps, videos on youtube explaining all this: (1) Get documentation, (2) Installation, (3) Consult demo input, (4) Create our input file usign def, (5) Add tables to our input file.

## Languages

* Language support: Adding French(fr) and Dutch(du).

---

## Better table keyword

* Process tables definitions with more than 2 fields.

## info keyword

* Add new keyword called info. Example:
```
%map{ :lang => 'en', :context => 'rock, bands', :version => '1'}
  %info Generic text about music, rock, bands, concerts, etc.
  %info more...
```
* When AI create new question may use (randomly) info text to be included into it. Example:
```
Rock music style was created for ....

Definition of [*]: Australian rock band formed by Scottish-born brothers Malcolm and Angus Young.

Select right option:
a. Led Zepellin
b. Beatles
c. ACDC
d. None
```

## Code inputs

Let's take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/dvarrui/asker/issues)

Actually we are experimenting with new keywords: code, type, path, features.

Example:

```
  %code
    %type ruby
    %path files/string1.rb
    %features
      %row Muestra en pantalla "Hola Mundo!"
```

Where `type` could be: ruby, python or sql.

> Also bash, math, crontab, fstab, etc.

## More output formats

* Images
    * Questions with images, sounds or other files embebed.
    * Embeded images into question texts
* Work on other export formats (Perhaps Moodle format)

## Etc

* Texts
    * Concept name drop and fill...
* Question types
    * crossword
    * type hangmann
* Dictionary
    * Diccionario de sinónimos, antónimos
    * Learn about the words or better download dictonary from RAE?

## Quizzer

* Export questions to YAML format then use them with app quizzer to create PDF exams.
* For example:
```
# Create output/funiture-questions.yaml
asker en/home/furniture.haml

# Create 3 PDF exams with 10 questions every one
quizzer 3x10 output/furniture-questions.yaml  
```

## Develop more Tests

* minitest for every class into lib directory
* Apply rubocop rules to all them.
