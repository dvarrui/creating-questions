# Version 2.2

* New definition tag: `def{:type => :file} PATH-TO-FILE`. This could use external files to work as concept definitions. We could use local text file, local image file and remote (URL) image.
* The tag `code` is experimental but it's usefull to generate questions from code file from JS, Python and Ruby by now.
* New export file format (Moodle XML). This export file include more questions than GIFT one. In the next future will be more new questions type into this file.
