# Installation

**Install** Asker:
1. Install Ruby on your system.
2. `gem install asker-tool`

Run `asker version` to check that your installation is ok.

> **Warning**: in the OpenSUSE operating system you have to look for the command with another name. For example, if you have `ruby2.5` installed, then the command is called `asker.ruby2.5` instead of `asker`.

**Update** Asker with `gem asker-tool update`.

**Uninstall** Asker with `gem uninstall asker-tool`
