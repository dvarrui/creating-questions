## Code inputs

Let's take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/dvarrui/asker/issues)

Actually we are experimenting with new keywords: code, type, path, features.

Example:

```
  %code
    %type ruby
    %path files/string1.rb
    %features
      %row Muestra en pantalla "Hola Mundo!"
```

Where `type` could be: ruby, python or sql.

> Also bash, math, crontab, fstab, etc.
